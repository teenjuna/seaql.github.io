One year ago, when we were writing data processing algorithms in Rust, we needed an async library to interface with a database. Back then, there weren't many choices. So we have to write our own.

December last year, we released [SeaQuery](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query), and received welcoming responses from the community. We decided to push the project further and develop a full blown async ORM.

It has been a bumpy ride, as designing an async ORM requires working within and sometimes around Rust's unique type system. After several iterations of experimentation, I think we've attained a balance between static & dynamic and compile-time & run-time that it offers benefits of the Rust language while still be familiar and easy-to-work-with for those who come from other languages.

SeaORM is tentative to be released in Sep 2021 and stabilize in May 2022. We hope that SeaORM will become a go-to choice for working with databases in Rust and that the Rust language will be adopted by more organizations in building applications.

If you are intrigued like I do, please stay in touch and join the community.
