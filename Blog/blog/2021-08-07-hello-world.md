After [8 months of secrecy](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query/discussions/9), SeaORM is now public!

The Rust async ecosystem is definitely thriving, with Tokio [announcing Axum](https://tokio.rs/blog/2021-07-announcing-axum) a week before.

We are now busy doing the brush ups to head towards our announcement in Sep.

If you stumbled upon us just now, well, hello! We sincerely invite you to be our alpha tester.
